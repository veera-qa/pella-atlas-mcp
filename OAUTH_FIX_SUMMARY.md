# OAuth State Parameter Fix - Summary

## Problem Diagnosed
The "Invalid state parameter" error was caused by several issues in your OAuth implementation:

### 1. **Redirect URI Mismatch**
- Your OAuth client was configured to redirect to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
- But your FastAPI routes were set up to handle `/auth/callback` (with router prefix)
- **Fixed**: Updated redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`

### 2. **Duplicate OAuth Routes**
- You had OAuth routes defined in both `main.py` and `routers/auth.py`
- This created conflicts and confusion about which routes were active
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate routes from `main.py` and properly included the auth router

### 3. **Double State Validation**
- State validation was happening in both the router and the OAuth service
- This could cause conflicts if the validations didn't align perfectly
- **Fixed**: Simplified to use only the router-level state validation

### 4. **Circular Import Issues**
- Router dependencies were trying to import from main.py incorrectly
- **Fixed**: Updated imports to use proper function calls instead of direct imports

## Changes Made

### 1. `atlassian_oauth.py`
```python
# Changed redirect URI from:
self.redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8080/callback'
# To:
self.redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8080/auth/callback'
```

### 2. `main.py`
- Removed duplicate OAuth routes (`/auth/login`, `/callback`, `/auth/callback`, `/oauth/callback`, `/auth/status`)
- Added proper router includes at the end of the file
- Kept the service functions and dependencies

### 3. `services/oauth_service.py`
- Removed duplicate state validation in `handle_oauth_callback`
- State validation is now only handled by the router

### 4. `routers/auth.py` & `routers/atlassian.py`
- Fixed dependency injection to avoid circular imports
- Updated to use `main.get_oauth_service()` instead of direct imports

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd c:\Users\450405\dev\atlas-mcp
C:/Users/450405/dev/atlas-mcp/.venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py
```

### 2. Test OAuth Flow
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/auth/login`
2. You should be redirected to Atlassian's OAuth page
3. After authorization, you should be redirected back to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`
4. The callback should successfully process and redirect you to the dashboard

### 3. Verify Configuration
- Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Atlassian OAuth credentials
- Ensure the redirect URI in your Atlassian app settings matches: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`

## Key Points for OAuth Security

1. **State Parameter**: Used to prevent CSRF attacks by ensuring the callback comes from the same session that initiated the OAuth flow
2. **Single Source of Truth**: State validation should happen in one place to avoid conflicts
3. **Proper Redirect URIs**: Must match exactly between your OAuth client configuration and your Atlassian app settings

## Next Steps

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Atlassian App Configuration**: 
   - Go to your Atlassian Developer Console
   - Verify the redirect URI is set to: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`

2. **Clear Browser State**: 
   - Clear cookies and session storage
   - Try in an incognito window

3. **Check Logs**: 
   - Look at the server console output for any error messages
   - Check the browser network tab for failed requests

The OAuth flow should now work correctly with proper state parameter handling!
